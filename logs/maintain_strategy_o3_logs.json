I will parry the check and develop at the same time: the knight from b1 goes to c3, plugging the diagonal a5-e1. If Black snatches the pinned knight with …Qxc3+ I answer bxc3, winning the queen, so the capture is impossible without huge loss. After Nc3 I want to continue exactly as before: Bf1-e2 and 0-0 to unpin the knight, then centralise the rooks (Re1, Rd1) and use my strong pawn duo d4/e4 to push e4-e5 or d4-d5. The light-squared bishop can stay on c1 for the moment (it still guards b2) and later come to e3, g5 or even h6 depending on Black’s set-up. I must keep an eye on the a- and b-files, where the black queen may roam, but once my king is castled my position will be solid with more space in the centre."

Material is level, but I now have two knights against White’s bishop pair, so I will steer the game toward a semi-closed structure that limits their bishops and highlights the agility of my knights."

Nevertheless the structure I wanted (c6–d5–e6) is still on the board and White’s advanced pawn on f6 can be eliminated at once: my remaining knight from d7 jumps back to the important f6 square.  From there it again eyes e4 and h5 and helps to guard g4-h3 around my king.  I will keep the solid kingside pawn screen g6–g7 (after the capture g7 remains), put the rooks on e8 and c8, and look for counter-play with …e5 or …c5 when the pieces are ready.  Being a piece down means I must avoid mass exchanges; instead I will aim for active piece play – the queen can later come to b6, a5 or even h8 to create threats against White’s king side, while the dark-squared bishop normally stays on d6 (dropping to c7 if hit by c4-c5).  The immediate priority, however, is to remove the intrusive pawn and restore coordination, which I do now."

With the e-file cleared the rook on f8 will swing to e8 at once, the other rook is earmarked for c8, and the queen will head to b6 or a5 to double against d4 and b2. The dark-squared bishop is still my most important piece; I will keep it on the board unless I gain something concrete. Further pawn breaks with …c5 or …e4 remain on the agenda—exchanges of pawns that open files are welcome, while exchanges of minor pieces are to be avoided unless they yield tangible profit."
